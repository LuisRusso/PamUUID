A PAM authentication module for Linux using USB Flash Drives. This module
will allow you to login to your system by inserting a USB drive, without
needing to type a password.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this software download or clone the GitHub repository.

Download:

```
wget https://github.com/LuisRusso/PamUUID/archive/master.zip
```

Clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:LuisRusso/PamUUID.git
```

### Prerequisites

The following components are used to install this software.

* linux and systemd (or similar)
* gcc, GNU compiler collection
* GNU Make
* [Linux-PAM]

### Installing

First check that you have the Linux-PAM lib installed. In [Debian] this can
be obtained by running:

```
apt-get install libpam0g-dev
```

Once this is installed you can check if everything is ok by compiling the
project. Simply execute

```
make
```

If all went well your build system is working with Linux-PAM, gcc, make,
etc. Otherwise if the Linux-PAM lib is missing your compile will complain
about this line.

`#include <security/pam_modules.h>`

Next determine if your system has the appropriate linux, systemd, udev
components. List the directory `/dev/disk/by-uuid/` with:

```
ls /dev/disk/by-uuid/
```

If this directory does not exist then you, most likely, do not have the
necessary components. Check with your distribution if it is located
elsewhere. If the directory exists then insert the pendrive you intend to
use and list the directory again. Check that a new file appears. The name
of the file corresponds to the uuid of the filesystem in the drive. It will
be unique to your system and it should have the folowing format:

* For most filesystems 32 hex digits separated as
  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (version 4 UUIDs), e.g.,
  7cec6c81-9eaa-44ad-8d6c-e607f3101627.

* For vfat filesystems 8 hex digits separated as xxxx-xxxx, e.g.,
  4059-33BB.

For more info check [Wikipedia].

If several files appeared or you are unsure about the correct UUID to use

```
ls -lh /dev/disk/by-uuid/
```

This lists the devices associated to the UUIDs, for all the partitions in
your system.

You can now edit the file `pam_uuid.h` file. This file was created by the
initial make.

```
editor pam_uuid.h
```

Locate the following line:

`{"John", "/dev/disk/by-uuid/", "7cec6c81-9eaa-44ad-8d6c-e607f3101627", plain},`

If your username is John then congratulations you only need to change the
UUID, the third entry in the list. Otherwise update the username also ;-)

You can also add more of these lines, for other users, or other pens.

For now the only authentication method is plain, so leave it.

Next compile the module. Run

```
make
```

After it compiles successfully you need to install it as root:

```
sudo make install
```

This copies the module to the `/lib/security` directory. You can list the
directory to make sure it is Ok. If the directory does not exist check with
your distribution and copy to the appropriate location.

The final step is authorizing the module. Edit the `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`
file as root.

```
sudo editor /etc/pam.d/common-auth
```

Add the following line before any other authorization:

```
auth sufficient pam_uuid.so
```

In this case the module becomes sufficient for authentication. You may use
more elaborated configurations, for example a two-factor authentication
process.

## FAQ

> If I install this module can I still login with a password?

Yes. You just won't have to.

> This module is not what I wanted. How do I remove it?

If you want to remove it you need to call the makefile again as
root. Execute

```
sudo make deinstall
```

This deletes the module from the `/lib/security` directory. In case the
module did not met your expectations or you need some specific feature
consider creating an [issue] about it or emailing me [lmsrusso@gmail.com].

> This module is pretty cool. How can I help?

Share it with your friends. Consider creating an issue with suggestions or
just send a "thank you" email to [lmsrusso@gmail.com].

> Do I have to use an UUID ?

No. All that the module does is to check if the file exists in your
filesystem. Therefore you can use any file, whatsoever. That being said, it
is probably a bad idea to use a file that resides permanently in the
filesystem. However you may want to use the labels of the
filesystems. These reside in `/dev/disk/by-label`. In this case you may
need to use [e2label] for ext filesystems or [fatlabel] for fat
filesystems.

If you have a spare pen you may want to use it as a backup authentication
pen. Just in case you lose your primary pen. In this case just use the same
label in both pens.

> How safe is PamUUID?

Depends on your usage. The module does not grant access to `ssh` logins.

If you have a pen that is registered in your `pam_uuid.h` it is
best not to insert it in any other computer, as the UUID and labels are
clearly accessible.

It is safer if you are using two factor authentication. In which case make
sure to have a backup authentication pen.

> This works for login but not for my screen saver?

Make sure to use a locker or screen saver that uses PAM, for example [sxlock].
