# PamUUID 0.1.0-alpha

A PAM authentication module for Linux using USB Flash Drives. This module
will allow you to login to your system by inserting a USB drive, without
needing to type a password.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this software download or clone the GitHub repository.

Download:

```
wget https://github.com/LuisRusso/PamUUID/archive/master.zip
```

Clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:LuisRusso/PamUUID.git
```

### Prerequisites

The following components are used to install this software.

* linux and systemd (or similar)
* gcc, GNU compiler collection
* GNU Make
* [Linux-PAM]

### Installing

First check that you have the Linux-PAM lib installed. In Debian this can
be obtained by running:

```
apt-get install libpam0g-dev
```

Once this is installed you can check if everything is ok by compiling the
project. Simply execute

```
make
```

If all went well your build system is working with Linux-PAM, gcc, make,
etc. Otherwise if the Linux-PAM lib is missing your compile will complain
about this line.

#include <security/pam_modules.h>

Next determine if your system has the appropriate linux, systemd, udev
components. List the directory /dev/disk/by-uuid/ with:

```
ls /dev/disk/by-uuid/
```

If this directory does not exist then you, most likely, do not have the
necessary components. Check with your distribution if it is located
elsewhere. If the directory exists then insert the pendrive you intend to
use and list the directory again. Check that a new file appears. The name
of the file corresponds to the uuid of the filesystem in the drive. It will
be unique to your system and it should have the folowing format:

* For most filesystems 32 hex digits separated as
  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (version 4 UUIDs), e.g.,
  7cec6c81-9eaa-44ad-8d6c-e607f3101627.

* For vfat filesystems 8 hex digits separated as xxxx-xxxx, e.g.,
  4059-33BB.

For more info check [Wikipedia].

If several files appeared or you are unsure about the correct UUID to use

```
ls -lh /dev/disk/by-uuid/
```

This lists the devices associated to the UUIDs, for all the partitions in
your system.

You can now edit the file pam_uuid.h file. This file was created by the
initial make. Locate the following line in the file:

{"John", "/dev/disk/by-uuid/", "7cec6c81-9eaa-44ad-8d6c-e607f3101627", plain},

If your username is John then congratulations you only need to change the
UUID, the third entry in the list. Otherwise update the username also ;-)

For now the only authentication method is plain, so leave it.

Next compile the module. Run

```
make
```

After it compiles successfully you need to install it as root:

```
sudo make install
```

This copies the module to the /lib/security directory. You can list the
directory to make sure it is Ok. If the directory does not exist check with
your distribution and copy to the appropriate location.

The final step is authorizing the module. Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-auth
file. Add the following line before any other authorization:

```
auth sufficient pam_uuid.so
```

In this case the module becomes sufficient for authentication. You may use
more elaborated configurations, for example a two-factor authentication
process.

## Post Install

If you want to remove this module just execute as root

```
make deinstall
```

This deletes the module from the /lib/security directory. In case the
module did not met your expectations or you need some specific feature
consider creating an issue about it.
